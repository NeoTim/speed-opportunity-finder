    <h2>Gathering the required credentials</h2>

    <p>There are a number of credentials required to use the agency dashboard solution.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Management Account ID</dt>
      <dd>This is the ID of the management account (MCC) that the solution will
          pull reports for.</dd>
      <dt>Client ID &amp; Client Secret</dt>
      <dd>These are the credentials created for the Cloud project for the Ads
          API.</dd>
      <dt>Developer Token</dt>
      <dd>This is a production developer token for the MCC you are using with
          the solution.</dt>
      <dt>PageSpeed Insights API key</dt>
      <dd>This is an API key for using pagespeed insights. This API runs the
          lighthouse test for you.</li>
    </dl>

    <h3>Finding your MCC ID</h3>

    <p>Your management account ID can be found on the Google Ads website once you have
      logged in. At the top of the page next to the name of the account is a 10-digit
      number in the format DDD-DDD-DDDD. This is the MCC ID.</p>
      <img src="./images/mcc_id.jpg" alt="MCC ID location" width="50%" >

    <h3>Creating the Client ID &amp; Secret</h3>

    <p>The Client ID and Secret are specific to the Google Cloud project you are
      hosting the solution on and can be created in the <em>API &amp; Services
      </em> panel of the Cloud Console. The process is 
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/authentication#create_a_client_id_and_client_secret">
        documented on the Google developers site.</a></p>
    <p>You will need to follow the instructions for an installed app. The steps
      should be:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select <strong>Create credentials</strong> and then <strong>OAuth client
          ID</strong></li>
      <li>Configure the consent screen</li>
      <li>Create the <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret
        </strong>.</li>
      <li>Copy the ID and secret for use in the solution configuration.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you have already created a project to host the solution, do not create
      another as part of the process of creating the credentials.</p>

    <h3>Getting a Google Ads Developer Token</h3>

    <p>You will require a production developer token to be able to use the
    Opportunity Finder with real accounts.</p>
    <p>You can find your developer token in the Google Ads frontend. Select
      the <em>API Center</em> option from the <em>Tools &amp; Settings</em> menu.
      </p>
      <img src="./images/dev_token_1.jpg" alt="API Center menu item" width="30%">
    <p>The Developer token should be the first item on the page. If the access
    level is <em>Test Account</em>, please click the link to apply for basic
    access. The solution will not work without a developer token with access to
    production accounts.</p>

    <h3>Requesting a PageSpeed Insights API Key</h3>

    <p>To make bulk requests to the Google PageSpeed Insights (PSI) API, you will
      require an API key. This is free, and allows you to make a maximum of 25k
      requests per day. The key is connected to a Google Cloud project, so you
      will need to create one before getting the PSI API key.</p>
    <p>To create an API key, follow the following steps:
      <ol>
        <li>Go to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started">PageSpeed Insights documentation</a>
          and click on the button labeled "Get a Key".<br>
          <img src="./images/get_psi_key.png" alt="Button to get a PSI API key" width="30%">
        </li>
        <li>In the resulting dialog, choose the cloud project you will be using
          for the solution and click "NEXT". If you haven't already created a project, you can
          choose "+ Create a new project" and create one now.<br>
          <img src="./images/choose_psi_api_project.png" alt="Select the cloud project to use." width="30%">
        </li>
        <li>Copy the API key shown in the resulting text box. Be sure to paste
          and save the API key somewhere safe. You will not be able to retrieve
          the key again.<br>
