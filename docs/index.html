    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      The speed opportunity finder solution is a set of services to automate the
      collection of data used to create reports on how landing page web 
      performance metrics impact Ads business metrics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data collected comes from Google Ads and the PageSpeed Insights API.
      An Ads Management account (MCC) is used to determine which Ads accounts
      are included in the data collection. The landing pages from the included
      accounts are audited via PageSpeed Insights (PSI). The solution runs on
      Google App Engine and all of the data is stored in BigQuery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The BigQuery tables are meant to be used as data sources for DataStudio
      dashboards. An example dashboard is provided as part of the solution, but
      it is meant to be copied and customized for the end client being targeted.
    </p>
