    <h2>Deploying the solution</h2>
    <p>Once you have the <a href="./credentials.html">credentials</a> required
      for the solution, follow the steps below to deploy it:</p>

    <h3>Preparing the Cloud Project</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If you haven't already, create a
        <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects">
        new Google Cloud Project</a>. You can also reuse an existing project if
        you prefer, but you will need to ensure none of the existing deployed apps
        and big query tables conflict with those required by the opportunity
        finder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a new App Engine application for the project. You can use the
        cloud shell for this with the command `gcloud app create` or use the web
        interface. For the web interface, open the hamburger menu, select <em>App
        Engine</em> from the list of options, and then click the <em>Create
        Application</em> button.<br>
        <img src="images/new_app_engine.png" alt="Click on the button" width="60%">
      </li>
      <li>
        Enable the Google Ads API for the project. From the APIs & Services
        Library, select the Google Ads API, and then click the <em>ENABLE</em>
        button on the API's details page.<br>
        <img src="./images/select_ads_api.png" alt="Select Google Ads API" width="40%">
      </li>
      <li>
        Enable BigQuery for the project by selecting BigQuery from the navigation
        menu and then clicking the <em>ENABLE</em> button on the BigQuery API
        page.<br>
        <img src="./images/enable_bigquery.png" alt="Enable BigQuery" width="40%">
      </li>
      <li>
        Enable Firestore in native mode for the project. Please be sure to
        select native mode. This cannot be changed, so if you choose Datastore
        mode, or are trying to reuse a project where Datastore mode is already
        in use, you will need to create a new project.<br>
        <img src="./images/firestore_native.png" alt="Choose Firestore native mode" width="40%">
      </li>
      <li>
        Enable the Cloud Tasks API for the project. From the APIs & Services
        Library, select the Cloud Tasks API and then click on the <em>ENABLE
        </em> button on the API details page.<br>
        <img src="./images/select_cloud_tasks.png" alt="Choose the Cloud Tasks API" width="40%">
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Deploying the solution</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the Google cloud console, clone the <a href="https://github.com/google/speed-opportunity-finder">
        solution repository</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the file <em>Controller-Service/service.yaml</em>, set the value of
        <code>APP_LOCATION</code> to the region you selected when creating the
        app engine app. If you aren't sure which region you chose, you can use
        command <code>$ gcloud config list</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the cloud console, run the install shell script:
        <code>$ bash ./install.sh</code>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Finishing the deployment</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Enter all of the <a href="./credentials.html">credentials</a> you
        gathered on the <em>config</em> page of your deployed app. This should
        be located at
        <code>http://config-service.&lt;YOUR PROJECT&gt;.appspot.com/config</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the credentials are entered, click the <em>Start OAuth Flow</em>
        button and compete the OAuth flow to provide the solution access to your
        Ads accounts. If successful, the page below will be shown. <strong>Please
        Note</strong>: This step must be carried out by someone with access to
        the MCC you are using for the solution.
      </li>
      <li>
        To test the solution and start the first round of data collection, ping
        the controller service. This should be located at
        <code>https://controller-service.&lt;YOUR PROJECT&gt;.appspot.com</code>
        . Please note that the page will likely time out before you receive a
        reply. To see if it worked, check the Cloud logs and the BigQuery
        tables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the Cloud project firewall rules to only allow access to the
        services, excepting the config service, from the app itself. This will
        ensure outside actors are not using project resources or adding unwanted
        data to the BigQuery tables.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Attaching the dashboard</h3>
    The final step is to attach the Data Studio dashboard to the backend. Follow
    the steps below to and be sure to copy the data sources first to ensure the
    calculated fields in the data sources are maintained.
    <ol>
      <li>Make a copy of both of the data studio data sources and connect them
        to appropriate BigQuery tables in your cloud project. The connectors can
        be found here:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://datastudio.google.com/datasources/62e27e18-338c-4f54-80a7-fe3d43302858">
            lh_data data source</a>
          </li>
          <li><a href="https://datastudio.google.com/datasources/b689944c-7d8a-4123-8fbf-4eaa5bedd2c9">
            ads_data data source</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        Use the copy icon, located next to the <em>CREATE REPORT</em> button, to
        make the copy.<br>
        <img src="./images/copy_data_source.png" alt="Data source copy button" width="40%">
      </li>
      <li>
        After confirming you want to copy the data source, a new window should
        open. Select your project, the agency_dashboard dataset, and the
        appropriate table for the connector being copied.<br>
        <img src="./images/choose_bq_table.png" alt="Choose the bigquery table" width="40%">
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a copy of the <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/u/2/reporting/3638a403-30c9-49e9-82a9-9f79ddd8999c/page/X3bCB/preview">
        dashboard template</a> To copy the template, click the
        <em>USE TEMPLATE</em> button at the top right of the page.<br>
        <img src="./images/use_report_template.png" alt="Click use template" width="40%">
      </li>
      <li>
        In the resulting dialog, choose the BigQuery data sources you created
        with your project tables.<br>
        <img src="./images/select_new_data_source.png" alt="Select the new data sources" width="40%">
